This project involves generating text similar to Dan Brown's style by preprocessing and cleaning the data, followed by building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) variant to achieve training results. The model was built using this network and trained to generate text that resembles Dan Brown's writing style. To measure the similarity between the generated text and Dan Brown's text, we used the Levenshtein distance algorithm.
